# QR Code Generator Requirements

## Overview

This project involves creating a simple QR code generator that allows a user to put a website URL into it and produce a QR code that can be downloaded.

The image that is downloaded will be used on a website.

The tool will need to be a desktop application.

## Minimum Viable Product

1. Have a method to input a URL.
2. Check that the URL is in a valid format. For example `https://` then the domain name and then the top-level domain name (either one or two levels (e.g. `.com` or `.co.uk`)).
3. Preview the QR code in the app.
4. Have a button to download the file to a web-safe file format. For example, `.jpeg` or `.png`.
